            <h1>Healthcare</h1>
            <p>"IoT has transformed healthcare by improving patient outcomes, reducing healthcare costs, and enhancing the overall quality of care. IoT devices such as wearable sensors, smart medical devices, and remote monitoring systems can collect real-time patient data and transmit it to healthcare providers. This enables doctors to monitor patients' conditions, adjust treatment plans, and provide timely interventions. IoT also enables patients to manage their own health through wearable devices that monitor vital signs and provide alerts when there are deviations from normal ranges.</p>
